## 📋 Configuration Examples

### Basic Multi-Plugin Deployment
```powershell
# Deploy development environment with all plugins
.\setup\multi-plugin-manager.ps1 install-all --profile development

# Deploy production environment with stable plugins only
.\setup\multi-plugin-manager.ps1 install-all --profile production

# List available plugins
.\setup\multi-plugin-manager.ps1 list

# Check deployment status
.\setup\multi-plugin-manager.ps1 status
```

### Plugin Configuration (plugins.yaml)
```yaml
plugins:
  available:
    - slug: "okvir-image-safe-migrator"
      name: "Okvir Image Safe Migrator"
      version: "1.0.0"
      priority: 1
