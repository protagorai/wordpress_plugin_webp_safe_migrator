# WebP Safe Migrator

Convert all non-WebP images in your WordPress media library to WebP at a fixed quality, safely update all usages and metadata, then (optionally) remove originals after validation. Includes WP-CLI, skip rules, change reports, and advanced processing options.

## ⚠️ Current Status & Limitations (v0.2.0)

This plugin is a strong prototype under active hardening. Before relying on it in production, be aware of the following (full details and roadmap in [`review.md`](review.md)):

- **Foreground batch conversion, validation/commit, and rollback work.** This is the recommended path today.
- **Background (async) processing is being reworked.** The legacy WP-Cron queue is not currently functional; use the foreground batch processor or WP-CLI.
- **AVIF / JPEG XL** require server support (GD `--with-avif` / Imagick with the relevant delegate). The admin UI only offers formats your server can actually produce. The provided Docker image now builds GD with AVIF.
- **Testing:** a PHPUnit + container test harness is included (`bin/test.sh`, `composer test`). Unit coverage is partial and integration coverage is still being expanded.
- **Always back up your database and uploads before a large migration**, and run with **validation mode ON** first.

### Development Resources

- **[🧪 Test Suite](tests/)** - Comprehensive testing framework
- **[💾 Source Code](src/)** - Plugin implementation files

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Environment Setup
```bash
# Quick start (Windows)
.\launch-webp-migrator.bat

# Quick start (Linux/macOS)
./launch-webp-migrator.sh
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
1. Launch environment (once per session)
2. Edit files in src/ directory  
3. Refresh WordPress admin - changes are live!
4. No container restart needed for code changes
```

**Key**: The `src/` directory is **volume-mounted** for instant code changes!

### Testing

The fastest way to run the full suite is the containerised harness — it stands up
MariaDB + a PHP-CLI container, installs the WordPress test library, and runs PHPUnit.
No local PHP/MySQL needed (just Docker or Podman):

```bash
./bin/test.sh
```

To run locally instead (requires PHP, Composer, MySQL/MariaDB and Subversion):

```bash
composer install
bin/install-wp-tests.sh wp_test root root 127.0.0.1 latest   # one-time
composer test                 # all suites
composer test:unit            # unit only
composer test:integration     # integration only
```

CI runs the suite across PHP 7.4/8.1/8.3 × WordPress 6.5/latest (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### Code Quality
- **PSR-12** coding standards
- **WordPress** coding standards compliance
- **PHPUnit** test coverage
- **Security** best practices

## 📋 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **WordPress**: 5.8+ (recommended: 6.x)
- **PHP**: 7.4+ (recommended: 8.1+)
- **Memory**: 256MB+ (512MB+ for large libraries)
- **WebP Support**: GD with `imagewebp()` or Imagick with WebP format

### Development Environment Requirements
- **Container Engine**: Podman (recommended) or Docker
- **See**: **[📦 System Requirements Guide](documentation/SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md)** for complete installation instructions

### Server Requirements
- File system write permissions to `wp-content/uploads/`
- Adequate execution time limits for batch processing
- Sufficient disk space for temporary backups

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Safety Features
- **Validation Mode**: Default setting keeps originals until you commit
- **Comprehensive Backups**: All originals safely stored before deletion
- **Detailed Reports**: Track every change made during conversion
- **Rollback Support**: Restore from backups if needed

### Performance Considerations
- Start with small batch sizes (10-25 images)
- Use background processing for large libraries (1000+ images)
- Monitor server resources during processing
- Clear caches after conversion
